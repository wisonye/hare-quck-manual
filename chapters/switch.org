* Switch

**  Example

#+BEGIN_SRC hare
  export fn main() void = {
          const byte = 8u8;

          switch (byte) {
                  case 1 => fmt::printfln(">>> That's 1")!;
                  case 2 => fmt::printfln(">>> That's 2")!;
                  case 3 => fmt::printfln(">>> That's 3")!;
                  //
                  // This is the `default` branch
                  //
                  case => fmt::printfln(">>> That's the rest of u8")!;
          };
  };
#+END_SRC


Note that =switch= expressions are required to be exhaustive, which means that every possible value of the =switch= value should have a corresponding branch. 

For example, if you miss the =case => fmt::printfln(">>> That's the rest of u8")!;= line in the above case, you will get the following error:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash

 hare/temp/src/main.ha:81:15: error: Switch expression isn't exhaustive

     |	              ^

#+END_SRC


** You can't use =switch= on a =tagged union=, otherwise, you will get the following errors:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  error: Cannot switch on tagged union type
#+END_SRC
