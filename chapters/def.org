* =def=

=def= declares a constant, for example:

#+BEGIN_SRC hare
  // [[duration]] representing a single nanosecond.
  export def NANOSECOND: duration = 1;
#+END_SRC

In this case, everywhere that =NANOSECOND= is used, it's substituted with =1=.

It's not exactly a pre-processor, since it's not substituting lexical tokens or manipulating the AST directly or anything like that, but it behaves somewhat similarly to using =#define= for constants (except it's the evaluated expression that's substituted, not the tokens themselves like with C's pre-processor).
